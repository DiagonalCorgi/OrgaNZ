Team 21 SENG302 project

Date: 08/03/2018
Authors: Jack Steel and Dylan Carlyle
Version: Sprint 1

The main objectives with the project was to create a Command Line Interface (CLI as referred to)
in order for users to create a donor profile and register themselves as donors. Our objectives
in this project was to make the command lines simple and easy to use, as well as to give a comprehensive
amount of data for the user to interpret, edit, save and delete.

We used a collection of Libraries such as google's GSON (for file saving to a JSON file) and picocli (for the
CLI), which helped us immensely in our efficiency at which we could achieve our tasks.

To start the application, run as a JAR file.

Please refer to the documentation found in "doc/user_manual" to find out more on how to use the CLI.

For more information on the design decisions that were made, please refer to the documentation found in
"doc/design_decisions".

To see an example of a JSON file that loads in the user data, please redirect your attention to
"doc/examples/savefile.JSON".
